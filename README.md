# Tipsy Tram Tour

Many of the greatest pubs in Debrecen can be found by following the path of Tram 1. Because following a tram track is hands-down easy even if you're drunk, why not visit all them pubs in one go? Enter Tipsy Tram Tour, your travel guide for getting under the table, currently accessible at [tipsy-tram-tour.surge.sh](http://tipsytramtour.surge.sh).

*Tipsy Tram Tour also serves as a Geoinformatics homework.* :wink:

## How can I run it locally?

Running Tipsy Tram Tour is as simple as:

~~~~bash
npm install
node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
~~~~

After the dev server spins up, you can access the Tour at `localhost:8080/dist`.
